In the electricity wholesale market in the USA, the electricity price is decided on each bus by the marginal cost of increamental load, which is call locational marginal price (LMP). The load will pay LMP of its location to the system operator and the generation will get paid by this LMP of its location too.

In a congested network, the locational marginal price (LMP) can be higher than the most expensive unit's price at some buses. Why would there be a price even higher than the most expensive generation unit? Although there is a mathematical explanation for the high price, it is important to have a physical example to show how this higher than most expensive unit LMP is formed.

In this example 3-bus system, the Line between Bus 1 and Bus 3 has a limit of 50 MW. The per unit impedance of Line B1-B3 is 0.3, Line B1-B2 0.1, B2-B3 0.2. 
The generator at Bus 1 generates 100 MW to satisfy the load on Bus 3 (100 MW). The electricity will flow on two paths to reach the load. The shortest path is from B1-B3, and longer path is B1-B2-B3. In this example system,
since the impedance of two pathes are the same, so the power flow on two pathes are the same.
