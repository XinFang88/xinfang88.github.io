# Why Can LMP at Some Locations Exceed the Most Expensive Unit's Price?

# Understanding Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP)
# In the U.S. electricity wholesale market, prices at each bus are determined by the marginal cost of supplying an additional unit of electricity,
# known as the locational marginal price (LMP). Consumers pay the LMP at their respective locations, while generators are compensated based on the LMP at their connection points.

# Under normal grid conditions, the LMP is typically influenced by the most expensive generator needed to meet demand.
# However, in a congested network, LMPs at certain locations can exceed the cost of the most expensive unit in operation.
# But why does this happen? While there is a mathematical explanation, a simple physical example can provide better intuition.

# A 3-Bus Example: Why Does LMP Spike?

# System Setup
transmission_lines = {
    "B1-B3": {"impedance": 0.3, "limit": 50},
    "B1-B2": {"impedance": 0.1},
    "B2-B3": {"impedance": 0.2}
}

generators = {
    "G1": {"bus": "B1", "cost": 10, "Pmax": 200},
    "G2": {"bus": "B2", "cost": 30, "Pmax": 200}
}

load = {"B3": 100}  # MW

# Initial Power Flow
initial_flow = {"B1-B3": 50, "B1-B2-B3": 50}  # MW

# Adding 1 MW at B3
added_load = 1  # MW
G2_increase = 3  # MW
G1_decrease = 2  # MW

# Compute LMP at B3
lmp_b3 = (G2_increase * generators["G2"]["cost"]) - (G1_decrease * generators["G1"]["cost"])

# Output the result directly
LMP_result = f"LMP at B3: ${lmp_b3}/MWh"

# Display the result
LMP_result

LMP at B3: $70/MWh


# Alternative Scenario: Removing Congestion by Switching Transmission Lines
# If the lines B1-B2-B3 had high capacity limits, it would be beneficial to open the B1-B3 line.
# This would allow all power to flow through B1-B2-B3 without congestion, resulting in an LMP of $10/MWh at B3,
# significantly reducing costs compared to the congested scenario.


# Key Takeaways
# - Congestion can drive LMP above the most expensive generator's cost due to forced redispatch.
# - Transmission constraints dictate power flows, sometimes requiring costly generation adjustments.
# - Investing in grid capacity can reduce congestion and stabilize prices.

# Understanding these dynamics is crucial for grid operators, market participants, and policymakers aiming to optimize market efficiency.
