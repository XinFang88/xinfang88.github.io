Welcome to the IDEAL Lab, where innovation meets impact under the visionary guidance of Dr. Xin Fang! We're at the forefront of pioneering intelligent decarbonization strategies, ensuring not just a renewable energy transition, but one that embodies equity and inclusiveness. Join us as we reimagine a world where affordable clean electricity for all isn't just a dream, but a tangible reality!

Xin Fang is an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Mississippi State University. He received his Ph. D. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, in 2016. He was the principal investigator of multiple Department of Energy-funded research projects on cyber-physical dynamic modeling for distributed energy resources integration.

Before joining Mississippi State University, he was a senior researcher at DoE National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, CO, from 2017 to 2022.

Xin Fang has been an Associate Editor of the Journal of Modern Power Systems and Clean Energy since 2019, an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Power Systems since 2020, and an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy since 2022. He is an Outstanding Reviewer of the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy for 2017, 2019, and 2021 and an Outstanding Reviewer of the IEEE Transactions on Power Systems for 2022 and 2023. He was an Outstanding Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy in 2022. He was an Outstanding Associate Editor for IEEE Transactions on Power Systems in 2023. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE.

I have multiple Ph.D. student openings for Spring and Fall 2024. The focusing areas include power system optimization, dynamics, transmission and distribution cosimulation, electric grid, and transportation cosimulation. A Master's degree is preferred for Ph.D. applications.
